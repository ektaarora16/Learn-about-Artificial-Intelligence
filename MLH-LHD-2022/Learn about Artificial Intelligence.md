## What is Artificial Intelligence?
The answer to this question would depend on who you ask. A layman, with a fleeting understanding of technology, would link it to robots. If you ask about artificial intelligence to an AI researcher, (s)he would say that it’s a set of algorithms that can produce results without having to be explicitly instructed to do so. Both of these answers are right. So to summarize, Artificial Intelligence is:

An intelligent entity created by humans.
Capable of performing tasks intelligently without being explicitly instructed.
Capable of thinking and acting rationally and humanely.
At the core of Artificial Intelligence, it is a branch of computer science that aims to create or replicate human intelligence in machines. But what makes a machine intelligent? Many AI systems are powered with the help of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. AI is constantly evolving, what was considered to be part of AI in the past may now just be looked at as a computer function. For example, a calculator may have been considered to be a part of AI in the past. Now, it is considered to be a simple function. Similarly, there are various levels of AI, let us understand those.

## Why is Artificial Intelligence Important?

The goal of Artificial Intelligence is to aid human capabilities and help us make advanced decisions with far-reaching consequences. From a technical standpoint, that is the main goal of AI. When we look at the importance of AI from a more philosophical perspective, we can say that it has the potential to help humans live more meaningful lives that are devoid of hard labour. AI can also help manage the complex web of interconnected individuals, companies, states and nations to function in a manner that’s beneficial to all of humanity.

Currently, Artificial Intelligence is shared by all the different tools and techniques have been invented by us over the last thousand years – to simplify human effort, and to help us make better decisions. Artificial Intelligence is one such creation that will help us in further inventing ground-breaking tools and services that would exponentially change how we lead our lives, by hopefully removing strife, inequality and human suffering.

We are still a long way from those kinds of outcomes. But it may come around in the future. Artificial Intelligence is currently being used mostly by companies to improve their process efficiencies, automate resource-heavy tasks, and to make business predictions based on data available to us. As you see, AI is significant to us in several ways. It is creating new opportunities in the world, helping us improve our productivity, and so much more. 

## Levels of Artificial Intelligence :

Artificial Intelligence can be divided into three main levels:

1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence
2. Artificial General Intelligence
3. Artificial Super-intelligence

## Applications of Artificial Intelligence :

Artificial intelligence has paved its way into several industries and areas today. From gaming to healthcare, the application of AI has increased immensely. Did you know that the Google Maps applications and facial recognition such as on the iPhone are all using AI technology to function? AI is all around us and is part of our daily lives more than we know it. If you wish to learn more about AI, you can take up the PGP Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Course offered by Great Learning. Here are a few applications of Artificial Intelligence.

## Best Applications of Artificial Intelligence 

1. Google’s AI-powered predictions (Google Maps)
2. Ride-sharing applications (Uber, Lyft)
3. AI Autopilot in Commercial Flights
4. Spam filters on Emails
5. Plagiarism checkers and tools
6. Facial Recognition
7. Search recommendations
8. Voice-to-text features
9. Smart personal assistants (Siri, Alexa)
10. Fraud protection and prevention

## Goals of Artificial Intelligence :

So far, you’ve seen what AI means, the different levels of AI, and its applications. But what are the goals of AI? What is the result that we aim to achieve through AI? The overall goal would be to allow machines and computers to learn and function intelligently. Some of the other goals of AI are as follows:

1. Problem-solving: Researchers developed algorithms that were able to imitate the step-by-step process that humans use while solving a puzzle. In the late 1980s and 1990s, research had reached a stage wherein methods had been developed to deal with incomplete or uncertain information. But for difficult problems, there is a need for enormous computational resources and memory power. Thus, the search for efficient problem-solving algorithms is one of the goals of artificial intelligence.
2. Knowledge representation: Machines are expected to solve problems that require extensive knowledge. Thus, knowledge representation is central to AI. Artificial intelligence represents objects, properties, events, cause and effect, and much more. 
3. Planning: One of the goals of AI should be to set intelligent goals and achieve them. Being able to make predictions about how actions will impact change, and what are the choices available. An AI agent will need to assess its environment and accordingly make predictions. This is why planning is important and can be considered as a goal of AI. 
5. Social Intelligence: Affective computing is essentially the study of systems that can interpret, recognize, and process human efforts. It is a confluence of computer science, psychology, and cognitive science. Social intelligence is another goal of AI as it is important to understand these fields before building algorithms. 

Thus, the overall goal of AI is to create technologies that can incorporate the above goals and create an intelligent machine that can help us work efficiently, make decisions faster, and improve security.
